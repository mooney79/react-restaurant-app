Vic's Pizza
A "client" has approached you and asked you to help them build a web presence. They are a local pizza parlor called Vic's Pizza. They don't know anything about the Internet, but they know they need a web page. They want an interactive menu that displays all of their food choices with prices, descriptions, etc. They also want the customer to be able to select menu items and create an order with a total price. When the user saves the order, it should create a new item on the backend so that the kitchen can process the order.
